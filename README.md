prompts
=======
A few prompts I made for use in Linux.
(psst, i use bashrc4!)

Installation
============
Select a bashrc file. (eg. bashrc1)

Put it in your home and name it

```
.bashrc
```

Don't forget the "."

Alternatively: You can use these using the terminal.

```
$ cd /directory/to/prompts-master/prompts/
$ mv bashrc1 ~/
$ cd ~
$ rename bashrc1 .bashrc
```
