prompts
=======
A few prompts I made for use in Bash.

Installation
============
### Linux/?
Copy a "bashrc*" file to your $HOME directory and rename it to:
```
.bashrc
```
Don't forget the "."

### Darwin/Mac OS X
Copy a "bashrc*" file to your $HOME directory and rename it to:
```
.bash_profile
```
Don't forget the "."
Share this project with others!

I made a short-link you can use to direct other people to this page.
